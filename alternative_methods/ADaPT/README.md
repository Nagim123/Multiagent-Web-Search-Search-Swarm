## Dependencies
This code uses the OpenAI API, please put your access key in `KEY.txt`. To run experiments on ALFWorld, and WebShop please install and set up the environments from the source repositories [alfworld](https://github.com/alfworld/alfworld), [webshop](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/WebShop) respectively. Our code base adds extra functionality on top of ALFWorld, please replace the `alfworld/agents/environment/alfred_tw_env.py` with the provided in our repository. To run the TextCraft environment, please download the [crafting recipes](https://github.com/InventivetalentDev/minecraft-assets/tree/1.16.5/data/minecraft/recipes) and store them in `TextCraft/recipes/`.

## Installation
The simplest way to run our code is to build separate conda environments.
```
conda create --name adaptllm --file requirements.txt python=3.7
conda activate adaptllm
cd ADaPT
```

## Running ADaPT
To run experiments on specific environments using ADaPT (Sec 5 of our paper) please run the environment specific files with the default parameters. The decomposition depth 'd' can be set using `max_depth` variable in all files. See examples below.
```
python run_alfworld.py
python run_textcraft.py
python run_webshop.py
```
